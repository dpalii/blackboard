# Blackboard

In this example, we have three concrete knowledge components (KnowledgeComponentA, KnowledgeComponentB, KnowledgeComponentC) that inherit from the abstract KnowledgeComponent class. Each knowledge component implements the Update method, which takes a Blackboard instance as a parameter. The components retrieve data from the blackboard, perform their calculations or operations, and update the blackboard with the new results.

The Blackboard class acts as the shared memory and holds the current state of the problem. It provides methods to retrieve and set data based on keys. The GetData method retrieves data of a specific type from the blackboard, and the SetData method sets data with a specific key.

In the Main method, we create an instance of the blackboard and set initial data. Then, we create instances of the knowledge components and register them. Finally, we call the Update method on each component, passing the blackboard as an argument. Each component performs its specific task based on the data on the blackboard.

The KnowledgeComponentC component displays the final result by retrieving the result from the blackboard and writing it to the console.

This example demonstrates the basic implementation of the Blackboard pattern in C#, where knowledge components communicate and update a shared blackboard to solve a problem.
